                  <h2>A Historical Marvel</h2>
      <p>Built in 1925, San Siro has a storied past that captivates fans and enthusiasts alike. It was initially intended to be the new home for both Milanese clubs, A.C.

Over the years, it has undergone several renovations and expansions, resulting in its current capacity of approximately 75,000 seats. The distinctive characteristic of San Siro lies in its unique double-tiered stands that envelop the pitch, ensuring an intimate atmosphere where fans can truly immerse themselves in the game. The impressive structure showcases the perfect blend of functionality, aesthetics, and acoustic engineering, creating an unforgettable experience for all those within its walls.</p>
      <h2>Magic Moments</h2>
